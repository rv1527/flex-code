Things to be worked on:

* Tests for %option user-init, %option pre-action, %option post-action.

* integrate examples directory into tests so that normal testing
  proves the examples are up to date.

* Do away with any need for -lfl by generating a default yywrap
  if the user doesn't specify one.
